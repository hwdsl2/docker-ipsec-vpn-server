Docker image to run an IPsec VPN server, with both `IPsec/L2TP` and `IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec")`.

Based on Debian Jessie with [Libreswan](https://libreswan.org) (IPsec VPN software) and [xl2tpd](https://github.com/xelerance/xl2tpd) (L2TP daemon).

## Install Docker

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/) to get Docker running on your Linux server.

## Download

Get the trusted build from the [Docker Hub registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server):

```
docker pull hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server
```

Alternatively, you may [build from source code](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server#build-from-source-code) on GitHub.

## How to use this image

### Environment variables

This Docker image uses the following three environment variables, that can be declared in an `env` file:

```
VPN_IPSEC_PSK=<IPsec pre-shared key>
VPN_USER=<VPN Username>
VPN_PASSWORD=<VPN Password>
```

This will create a single user account for VPN login. The IPsec PSK (pre-shared key) is specified by the `VPN_IPSEC_PSK` environment variable. The VPN username is defined in `VPN_USER`, and VPN password is specified by `VPN_PASSWORD`.

**Note 1:** In your `env` file, DO NOT put single or double quotes around values, or add space around `=`. Also, DO NOT use these characters within values: `\ " '`.

**Note 2:** The same VPN account can be used by your multiple devices. However, due to an IPsec limitation, only one device behind the same NAT (e.g. home router) can connect to the VPN server at a time.

All the variables to this image are optional, which means you don't have to type in any environment variable, and you can have an IPsec VPN server out of the box! Read the sections below for details.

### Start the IPsec VPN server

**Important:** First, load the IPsec `NETKEY` kernel module on the Docker host:

```
sudo modprobe af_key
```

Create a new Docker container from this image (replace `./vpn.env` with your own `env` file):

```
docker run \
    --name ipsec-vpn-server \
    --env-file ./vpn.env \
    --restart=always \
    -p 500:500/udp \
    -p 4500:4500/udp \
    -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro \
    -d --privileged \
    hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server
```

### Retrieve VPN login details

If you did not specify an `env` file in the `docker run` command above, `VPN_USER` will default to `vpnuser` and both `VPN_IPSEC_PSK` and `VPN_PASSWORD` will be randomly generated. To retrieve them, view the container logs:

```
docker logs ipsec-vpn-server
```

Search for these lines in the output:

```
Connect to your new VPN with these details:

Server IP: <VPN Server IP>
IPsec PSK: <IPsec pre-shared key>
Username: <VPN Username>
Password: <VPN Password>
```

(Optional) Backup the generated VPN credentials (if any) to the current directory:

```
docker cp ipsec-vpn-server:/opt/src/vpn-gen.env ./
```

### Check server status

To check the status of your IPsec VPN server, you can pass `ipsec status` to your container like this:

```
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server ipsec status
```

## Next steps

Get your computer or device to use the VPN. Please refer to:

[Configure IPsec/L2TP VPN Clients](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients.md)   
[Configure IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec") VPN Clients](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients-xauth.md)

If you get an error when trying to connect, see [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients.md#troubleshooting).

Enjoy your very own VPN!

## Technical details

There are two services running: `Libreswan (pluto)` for the IPsec VPN, and `xl2tpd` for L2TP support.

Clients are configured to use [Google Public DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/) when the VPN connection is active.

The default IPsec configuration supports:

* IKEv1 with PSK and XAuth ("Cisco IPsec")
* IPsec/L2TP with PSK

The ports that are exposed for this container to work are:

* 4500/udp and 500/udp for IPsec

## Advanced usage

### Build from source code

Advanced users can download and compile the source code from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server.git
cd docker-ipsec-vpn-server
docker build -t hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server .
```

or use this if not modifying the source code:

```
docker build -t hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server.git
```

### Bash shell inside container

To start a Bash session in the running container:

```
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server env TERM=xterm bash -l
```
