## Use alternative DNS servers

By default, clients are set to use [Google Public DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/) when the VPN is active. If another DNS provider is preferred, define `VPN_DNS_SRV1` and optionally `VPN_DNS_SRV2` in your `env` file, then follow [instructions](../README.md#update-docker-image) to re-create the Docker container. Example:

```
VPN_DNS_SRV1=1.1.1.1
VPN_DNS_SRV2=1.0.0.1
```

Use `VPN_DNS_SRV1` to specify the primary DNS server, and `VPN_DNS_SRV2` to specify the secondary DNS server (optional).

Note that if IKEv2 is already set up in the Docker container, you will also need to edit `/etc/ipsec.d/ikev2.conf` inside the Docker container and replace `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4` with your alternative DNS server(s), then restart the Docker container.

Below is a list of some popular public DNS providers for your reference.

| Provider | Primary DNS | Secondary DNS | Notes |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----- |
| [Google Public DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns) | 8.8.8.8 | 8.8.4.4 | Default in this project |
| [Cloudflare](https://1.1.1.1/dns/) | 1.1.1.1 | 1.0.0.1 | See also: [Cloudflare for families](https://1.1.1.1/family/) |
| [Quad9](https://www.quad9.net) | 9.9.9.9 | 149.112.112.112 | Blocks malicious domains |
| [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/) | 208.67.222.222 | 208.67.220.220 | Blocks phishing domains, configurable. |
| [CleanBrowsing](https://cleanbrowsing.org/filters/) | 185.228.168.9 | 185.228.169.9 | [Domain filters](https://cleanbrowsing.org/filters/) available |

| [Control D](https://controld.com/free-dns) | Varies | Varies | Ad blocking, configurable. [Learn more](https://controld.com/free-dns). |

## Run without privileged mode

Advanced users can create a Docker container from this image without using [privileged mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities) (replace `./vpn.env` in the command below with your own `env` file).

**Note:** If your Docker host runs CentOS Stream, Oracle Linux 8+, Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux, it is recommended to use [privileged mode](../README.md#start-the-ipsec-vpn-server). If you want to run without privileged mode, you **must** run `modprobe ip_tables` before creating the Docker container and also on boot.

```
docker run \
    --name ipsec-vpn-server \
    --env-file ./vpn.env \
    --restart=always \
    -v ikev2-vpn-data:/etc/ipsec.d \
    -p 500:500/udp \
    -p 4500:4500/udp \
    -d --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
    --device=/dev/ppp \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0 \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0 \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0 \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects=0 \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0 \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=0 \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.eth0.send_redirects=0 \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.eth0.rp_filter=0 \
    hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server
```

When running without privileged mode, the container is unable to change `sysctl` settings. This could affect certain features of this image. A known issue is that the [Android/Linux MTU/MSS fix](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients.md#androidlinux-mtumss-issues) also requires adding `--sysctl net.ipv4.ip_no_pmtu_disc=1` to the `docker run` command. If you encounter any issues, try re-creating the container using [privileged mode](../README.md#start-the-ipsec-vpn-server).

After creating the Docker container, see [Retrieve VPN login details](../README.md#retrieve-vpn-login-details).

Similarly, if using [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), you may replace `privileged: true` in [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) with:

```
  cap_add:
    - NET_ADMIN
  devices:
    - "/dev/ppp:/dev/ppp"
  sysctls:
    - net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    - net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0
    - net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0
    - net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0
    - net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects=0
    - net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0
    - net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=0
    - net.ipv4.conf.eth0.send_redirects=0
    - net.ipv4.conf.eth0.rp_filter=0
```

For more information, see [compose file reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/).

## Select VPN modes

Using this Docker image, the IPsec/L2TP and IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec") modes are enabled by default. In addition, IKEv2 mode will be enabled if the `-v ikev2-vpn-data:/etc/ipsec.d` option [is specified](../README.md#start-the-ipsec-vpn-server) in the `docker run` command when creating the Docker container.

Advanced users can selectively disable VPN modes by setting the following variable(s) in the `env` file, then re-create the Docker container.

Disable IPsec/L2TP mode: `VPN_DISABLE_IPSEC_L2TP=yes`   
Disable IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec") mode: `VPN_DISABLE_IPSEC_XAUTH=yes`   
Disable both IPsec/L2TP and IPsec/XAuth modes: `VPN_IKEV2_ONLY=yes`

## Access other containers on the Docker host

After connecting to the VPN, VPN clients can generally access services running in other containers on the same Docker host, without additional configuration.

For example, if the IPsec VPN server container has IP `172.17.0.2`, and an Nginx container with IP `172.17.0.3` is running on the same Docker host, VPN clients can use IP `172.17.0.3` to access services on the Nginx container. To find out which IP is assigned to a container, run `docker inspect <container name>`.

## Specify VPN server's public IP

On Docker hosts with multiple public IP addresses, advanced users can specify a public IP for the VPN server using variable `VPN_PUBLIC_IP` in the `env` file, then re-create the Docker container. For example, if the Docker host has IPs `192.0.2.1` and `192.0.2.2`, and you want the VPN server to use `192.0.2.2`:

```
VPN_PUBLIC_IP=192.0.2.2
```

Note that this variable has no effect for IKEv2 mode, if IKEv2 is already set up in the Docker container. In this case, you may remove IKEv2 and set it up again using custom options. Refer to [Configure and use IKEv2 VPN](../README.md#configure-and-use-ikev2-vpn).

Additional configuration may be required if you want VPN clients to use the specified public IP as their "outgoing IP" when the VPN connection is active, and the specified IP is NOT the main IP (or default route) on the Docker host. In this case, you can try adding an IPTables `SNAT` rule on the Docker host. To persist after reboot, you may add the command to `/etc/rc.local`.

Continuing with the example above, if the Docker container has internal IP `172.17.0.2` (check using `docker inspect ipsec-vpn-server`), Docker's network interface name is `docker0` (check using `iptables -nvL -t nat`), and you want the "outgoing IP" to be `192.0.2.2`:

```
iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -s 172.17.0.2 ! -o docker0 -j SNAT --to 192.0.2.2
```

To check the "outgoing IP" for a connected VPN client, you may open a browser on the client and [look up the IP address on Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=my+ip).

## Assign static IPs to VPN clients

When connecting using IPsec/L2TP mode, the VPN server (Docker container) has internal IP `192.168.42.1` within the VPN subnet `192.168.42.0/24`. Clients are assigned internal IPs from `192.168.42.10` to `192.168.42.250`. To check which IP is assigned to a client, view the connection status on the VPN client.

When connecting using IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec") or IKEv2 mode, the VPN server (Docker container) does NOT have an internal IP within the VPN subnet `192.168.43.0/24`. Clients are assigned internal IPs from `192.168.43.10` to `192.168.43.250`.

Advanced users may optionally assign static IPs to VPN clients. IKEv2 mode does NOT support this feature. To assign static IPs, declare the `VPN_ADDL_IP_ADDRS` variable in your `env` file, then re-create the Docker container. Example:

```
VPN_ADDL_USERS=user1 user2 user3 user4 user5
VPN_ADDL_PASSWORDS=pass1 pass2 pass3 pass4 pass5
VPN_ADDL_IP_ADDRS=* * 192.168.42.2 192.168.43.2
```

In this example, we assign static IP `192.168.42.2` for `user3` for IPsec/L2TP mode, and assign static IP `192.168.43.2` for `user4` for IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec") mode. Internal IPs for `user1`, `user2` and `user5` will be auto-assigned. The internal IP for `user3` for IPsec/XAuth mode and the internal IP for `user4` for IPsec/L2TP mode will also be auto-assigned. You may use `*` to specify auto-assigned IPs, or put those user(s) at the end of the list.

Static IPs that you specify for IPsec/L2TP mode must be within the range from `192.168.42.2` to `192.168.42.9`. Static IPs that you specify for IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec") mode must be within the range from `192.168.43.2` to `192.168.43.9`.

If you need to assign more static IPs, you must shrink the pool of auto-assigned IP addresses. Example:

```
VPN_L2TP_POOL=192.168.42.100-192.168.42.250
VPN_XAUTH_POOL=192.168.43.100-192.168.43.250
```

This will allow you to assign static IPs within the range from `192.168.42.2` to `192.168.42.99` for IPsec/L2TP mode, and within the range from `192.168.43.2` to `192.168.43.99` for IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec") mode.

Note that if you specify `VPN_XAUTH_POOL` in the `env` file, and IKEv2 is already set up in the Docker container, you **must** manually edit `/etc/ipsec.d/ikev2.conf` inside the container and replace `rightaddresspool=192.168.43.10-192.168.43.250` with the **same value** as `VPN_XAUTH_POOL`, before re-creating the Docker container. Otherwise, IKEv2 may stop working.

**Note:** In your `env` file, DO NOT put `""` or `''` around values, or add space around `=`. DO NOT use these special characters within values: `\ " '`.

## Customize VPN subnets

By default, IPsec/L2TP VPN clients will use internal VPN subnet `192.168.42.0/24`, while IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec") and IKEv2 VPN clients will use internal VPN subnet `192.168.43.0/24`. For more details, read the previous section.

For most use cases, it is NOT necessary and NOT recommended to customize these subnets. If your use case requires it, however, you may specify custom subnet(s) in your `env` file, then you must re-create the Docker container.

```
# Example: Specify custom VPN subnet for IPsec/L2TP mode
# Note: All three variables must be specified.
VPN_L2TP_NET=10.1.0.0/16
VPN_L2TP_LOCAL=10.1.0.1
VPN_L2TP_POOL=10.1.0.10-10.1.254.254
```

```
# Example: Specify custom VPN subnet for IPsec/XAuth and IKEv2 modes
# Note: Both variables must be specified.
VPN_XAUTH_NET=10.2.0.0/16
VPN_XAUTH_POOL=10.2.0.10-10.2.254.254
```

**Note:** In your `env` file, DO NOT put `""` or `''` around values, or add space around `=`.

In the examples above, `VPN_L2TP_LOCAL` is the VPN server's internal IP for IPsec/L2TP mode. `VPN_L2TP_POOL` and `VPN_XAUTH_POOL` are the pools of auto-assigned IP addresses for VPN clients.

Note that if you specify `VPN_XAUTH_POOL` in the `env` file, and IKEv2 is already set up in the Docker container, you **must** manually edit `/etc/ipsec.d/ikev2.conf` inside the container and replace `rightaddresspool=192.168.43.10-192.168.43.250` with the **same value** as `VPN_XAUTH_POOL`, before re-creating the Docker container. Otherwise, IKEv2 may stop working.

## About host network mode

Advanced users can run this image in [host network mode](https://docs.docker.com/network/host/), by adding `--network=host` to the `docker run` command. In addition, if [running without privileged mode](#run-without-privileged-mode), you may also need to replace `eth0` with the network interface name of your Docker host.

Host network mode is NOT recommended for this image, unless your use case requires it. In this mode, the container's network stack is not isolated from the Docker host, and VPN clients may be able to access ports or services on the Docker host using its internal VPN IP `192.168.42.1` after connecting using IPsec/L2TP mode. Note that you will need to manually clean up the changes to IPTables rules and sysctl settings by [run.sh](../run.sh) or reboot the server when you no longer use this image.

Some Docker host OS, such as Debian 10, cannot run this image in host network mode due to the use of nftables.

## Enable Libreswan logs

To keep the Docker image small, Libreswan (IPsec) logs are not enabled by default. If you need to enable it for troubleshooting purposes, first start a Bash session in the running container:

```
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server env TERM=xterm bash -l
```

Then run the following commands:

```
# For Alpine-based image
apk add --no-cache rsyslog
rsyslogd
rc-service ipsec stop; rc-service -D ipsec start >/dev/null 2>&1
sed -i '/pluto\.pid/a rsyslogd' /opt/src/run.sh
exit
# For Debian-based image
apt-get update && apt-get -y install rsyslog
rsyslogd
service ipsec restart
sed -i '/pluto\.pid/a rsyslogd' /opt/src/run.sh
exit
```

**Note:** The error `rsyslogd: imklog: cannot open kernel log` is normal if you use this Docker image without privileged mode.

When finished, you may check Libreswan logs with:

```
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server grep pluto /var/log/auth.log
```

To check xl2tpd logs, run `docker logs ipsec-vpn-server`.

## Check server status

Check the status of the IPsec VPN server:

```
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server ipsec status
```

Show currently established VPN connections:

```
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server ipsec trafficstatus
```

## Build from source code

Advanced users can download and compile the source code from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server
cd docker-ipsec-vpn-server
# To build Alpine-based image
docker build -t hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server .
# To build Debian-based image
docker build -f Dockerfile.debian -t hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server:debian .
```

Or use this if not modifying the source code:

```
# To build Alpine-based image
docker build -t hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server
# To build Debian-based image
docker build -f Dockerfile.debian -t hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server:debian \
  github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server
```

## Bash shell inside container

To start a Bash session in the running container:

```
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server env TERM=xterm bash -l
```

(Optional) Install the `nano` editor:

```
# For Alpine-based image
apk add --no-cache nano
# For Debian-based image
apt-get update && apt-get -y install nano
```

Then run your commands inside the container. When finished, exit the container and restart if needed:

```
exit
docker restart ipsec-vpn-server
```

## Bind mount the env file

As an alternative to the `--env-file` option, advanced users can bind mount the `env` file. The advantage of this method is that after updating the `env` file, you can restart the Docker container to take effect instead of re-creating it. To use this method, you must first edit your `env` file and use single quotes `''` to enclose the values of all variables. Then (re-)create the Docker container (replace the first `vpn.env` with your own `env` file):

```
docker run \
    --name ipsec-vpn-server \
    --restart=always \
    -v "$(pwd)/vpn.env:/opt/src/env/vpn.env:ro" \
    -v ikev2-vpn-data:/etc/ipsec.d \
    -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro \
    -p 500:500/udp \
    -p 4500:4500/udp \
    -d --privileged \
    hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server
```

## Deploy Google BBR congestion control

After the VPN server is set up, the performance can be improved by deploying the Google BBR congestion control algorithm on your Docker host.

This is usually done by modifying the configuration file `/etc/sysctl.conf`. However, some Linux distributions may additionally require updates to the Linux kernel.

For detailed deployment methods, please refer to [this document](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/bbr.md). When finished, restart the Docker container:

```
docker restart ipsec-vpn-server
```

## Use a split VPN configuration

With IKEv2 only, you can use `VPN_SPLIT_IKEV2` in the `env` file to specify a subnet. Only addresses belonging to this subnet will be routed through the VPN. This allows you to gain secure access to a LAN through your vpn without routing all your client's traffic through the VPN.

Example: Make subnet 192.168.0.0/8 the only routed through the VPN : add to the `env` file :
```
VPN_SPLIT_IKEV2=192.168.0.0/8
```
